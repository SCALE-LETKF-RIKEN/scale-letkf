\section{About SCALE-LETKF}

SCALE-LETKF is a data assimilation and numerical weather prediction system utilizing the regional model SCALE-RM and the data assimilation method Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF; \citet{Hunt2007}). 

\section{Version and history}

The current version of SCALE-LETKF is \textbf{5.5.5-v1}.  

SCALE-LETKF has been developed since 2014, when the prototype was made by Guo-Yuan Lien. The first research papers which used SCALE-LETKF were published in 2016 \citep{Miyoshi2016_BAMS,Miyoshi2016_IEEE}. 

The development of SCALE-LETKF continues in the Data Assimilation Research Team of RIKEN Center for Computational Science (R-CCS).
